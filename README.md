# unnamed-language

A (currently unnamed) functional programming language by me and
[@RaineDelay](https://github.com/RaineDelay) -- mostly for fun. Uses syntax
largely inspired by Rust, Lisp, Haskell, and other languages that integrate
ideas from type theory, category theory, and functional programming. One of our
goals is to create a language that is as purely functional as possible while
still being practically usable.

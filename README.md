# unnamed-language

A (currently unnamed) functional programming language by me and
[@RaineDelay](https://github.com/RaineDelay) -- mostly for fun. Uses syntax
largely inspired by Rust, Lisp, Haskell, and other languages that integrate
ideas from type theory, category theory, and functional programming. One of our
goals is to create a language that is as purely functional as possible while
still being practically usable.

## Branches

A summary of the branches in this repository.

- `main`: self-explanatory (all merges into this branch should be facilitated
  by pull requests)
- `stdlib`: various standard library functions, types, modules, etc.
- `syntax`: experiments and drafts defining the syntax and semantics of the
  language
- `docs`: documentation, including usage guides and examples (the standard
  library module used for documentation generation is in a different branch)
- `grammar`: grammar specifications used to assist in designing and
  implementing compilers for the language
- `examples`: examples of basic programming tasks used both to inform the
  design process and to document usage of the language
